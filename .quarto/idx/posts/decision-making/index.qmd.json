Entrepreneurs, for instance, often rely on their intuition to make strategic decisions about new products or markets. \n\n    _This approach can be prone to cognitive biases and may not always be repeatable or justifiable to others._\n\nIn practice, the most effective decision-making often involves a combination of both data-driven and intuition-based methods. This is often called \"data-informed\" decision-making. It means you use data as a key input, but you also consider other factors, like your own intuition, qualitative insights, and contextual factors that the data may not fully capture. This approach provides a more holistic view of the situation and allows for more nuanced and adaptable decisions.\n\nRemember that data is a tool to inform decisions, not to make them.
