abstract: "Euler's Identity is a mathematical formula that connects five of the most fundamental numbers in mathematics: 0, 1, e, pi, and i. It is often cited as an example of deep mathematical beauty due to its simplicity and elegance. The formula is derived from Euler's formula, which relates the exponential function to the trigonometric functions. Euler's Identity has important applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science, and has been the subject of much study and fascination among mathematicians and scientists for centuries."

### Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep mathematical beauty. Three basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once and combine five fundamental mathematical constants [[1](#1)].

**The Identity**

Starting from Euler's formula $e^{ix}=\cos x + i\sin x$ for any real number $x$, we get to Euler's identity with the special case of $x = \pi$

$$e^{i\pi}+1=0\,.$$ (1)

The arithmetic operations *addition*, *multiplication* and *exponentiation* combine the fundamental constants 

* the additive identity $0$.
* the multiplicative identity $1$.
* the circle constant $\pi$.
* Euler's number $e$.
* the imaginary constant $i$.

**Conclusion**

It has been shown, how Euler's identity makes a valid formula from five mathematical constants.
